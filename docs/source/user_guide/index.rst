This guide goes over what *FhY* intends to achieve, its important features, and how to get started writing programs.

Currently, *FhY*, the f-DFG, and the back-end components are not linked; the full compilation flow is a work in progress.
However, the *FhY* `front-end language repository <https://github.com/actlab-fhy/FhY>`_ has a basic CLI that can parse, check, and print the AST of a given program.
Get started writing *FhY* programs in preparation for the full compilation flow!
Read the `introduction <../design_blog/post_2024-04-04.html>`_ post as well to learn how to write programs.
