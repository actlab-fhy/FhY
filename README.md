*A Language for Modeling Physical Things*

*FhY* is a cross-domain language with mathematical foundations that moves beyond the
current paradigm of domain-specific languages to enable cross-domain multi-acceleration.

We are currently working on the **first major release** of *FhY* and are getting very close!
If you would like to see our current progress, please check out the `dev` branch.
